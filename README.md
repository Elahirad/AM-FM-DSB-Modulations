# AM, DSB-SC, and FM Modulation simulations in MATLAB

I used MATLAB m-file environment for doing the AM Modulation simulation.

I did the FM and DSB-SC simulations in the Simulink environment.

**Notes :**
- Start AM simulation by running AM_Modulation.m file.
- Do the simulation for an audio signal with the AM_sound.m file.
- For FM simulation, open the FM.slx file.
- For DSB-SC simulation, open the DSB.slx file.
